I am currently watching **King the Land** and I am absolutely in love with how smitten the ML is with the FL. It‚Äôs just such a joy watching how in love with her he is. And it‚Äôs made me realize I really love the trope of the ML not only falling in love first but also falling hardest, so I was wondering what dramas you would recommend that would fit this?\n\nSome ones I‚Äôve already watched, and loved, where the ML is completely smitten:\n\nA Business Proposal\n\nCrash Course in Romance\n\nCrash Landing On You\n\nHappiness - not a romance obviously but the ML definitely fits the trope imo\n\nHer Private Life\n\nLove to Hate You\n\nSoundtrack #1\n\nWhat‚Äôs Wrong with Secretary Kim \n\nWhile You Were Sleeping\n\nAny help is very much appreciated!! \n\n^(END OF POST BODY) \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The ML is a bit standoffish CEO who falls for the FL the second he sees her and starts pursuing her, is obsessed with her, always worries about her and does everything in his power to make her happy and be in her company. There‚Äôs also a love triangle that makes the ML even more posessive and jealous. It gave me sooo much butterflies!! :)\n\nAnother one of my top favourites is Destined with You. The ML is a rich, handsome, arrogant and at first cold lawyer who deals with a curse that runs in his family line. He ends up falling in love with a lonely civil servant FL, which they believe to be caused by a love spell. Likewise here, he starts pursuining her, trying to be in her company, gets protective of her (while at first also trying to fight his feelings in vain). He gets immensly worried when something happens to the FL and ends up saving her from a scary situation several times. There‚Äôs also a love triangle in this one as well, which makes the ML all the more possesive too. If you don‚Äôt mind that there‚Äôs a fantasy element and a theme of destiny / fate / past lives, I think you will love this one too. :)",

Probably on of the few obsessed ML and triangle ill watch. Just because it makes sense and you kinda want it, because why not!\n\nHer Private Life- very similar trope to Secretary Kim, and it's Park min young again. But has more obsession. It starts around episode 3, until u get some satisfying watch with the trope of your choice.\n\nDescendants of the Sun- it's a blockbuster. And very kdrama tropy obssessed ML type show. Not chabeol but an action drama.\n\nBoyfriend- another Song Hye Kyo show and with Park Bo Gum. This is up in your alley. Episode 1 sets the whole trope up. Then u gonna want more. \n\nSomething in the Rain- edgy, and romantic at the same time. Lots of Angst. But it may also give u a break of ur usual kdrama trope at the later episodes.\n\nItaewon Class- not feeling the weird triangle but u dont ever get the SLS, is more ML obsession and revenge than what its worth. Plus u get FL obsession on the other side too. Good show as well. You'll forget the ML FL BS half the time. \n\nLast for now,,\nCheese in the trap-- you'll get your fill in this one. Now this one is an obsession to another level. \n\nIve seen hundreds of kdrama since 2007. And lots of the comments I recommend as well. So dont overwhelmed yourself. I just listed what made sense and remember in my head \n\nKdrama is filled with FL or ML obsessed shows and of course love triangles.

I‚Äôm on the lookout for a Korean drama with a male lead who‚Äôs incredibly possessive and obsessive over the female lead. I want the male character to be super protective, always wanting to be around her, and not allowing anyone to get too close to her or take her away. I‚Äôm looking for a character who‚Äôs affectionate‚Äîlots of skinship, like holding hands, hugging, kissing, and wanting to be physically close all the time.\n\nI‚Äôm open to dramas with a love triangle, and a bonus would be if the male lead is a chaebol.\n\nHere‚Äôs a list of dramas I‚Äôve seen and what I liked:\n\n* 1% of Something ‚Äì This is what I am looking for. The male lead was everything i wanted. His obsession with the female lead knew no bounds and I love how this kdrama involved lots of skinship. \n* King the Land ‚Äì This kdrama ticks all the right boxes for me. Love the transistion the ML and the FL went through. Everytime they would kiss i would feel the butterflies in my tummy\n* What‚Äôs Wrong with Secretary Kim ‚Äì Park Seo Joon is and Rachel Park are so hot together in this one. I love how the main lead just kept chasing the female lead despite her initial reluctance. The male lead was not yandere but I still loved his obsessive shades.\n* Business proposal - very similar to king the land but I would say the male lead here was not obsessive enough to my liking.\n* Noble my love - just love it. Sung Hoon in a kdrama as an obsessive chaebol is right up my alley. I hated that this had only 7 episodes.\n* Crazy love- This drama helped me fall head over heels with Kim Jae Wook.  After 1 percent of something this is something i will keep watching again and again.\n\nDramas I couldnt finish\n\n* Love struck in the city: The plot was too chaotic for me to concentrate on the main couple. Too many side characters led me to drop this after 7 episodes\n* the kings affection: not a big fan of historical kdramas\n* she would never know: the plot had nothing interesting and I missed my chaebol troupe since it was an office romance\n\nPlease recommend me more kdramas with an obsessive male lead as described above. **Please do not recommend anything that is too old , also I am not into cdramas or anything other kdramas so please do not recommed any of those.** \n\nThanks in advance for your recommendations :) \n\n^(END OF POST BODY) \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It‚Äôs one of the things I look for too.\n\nHope you are still looking for kdrama as I‚Äôve read the whole thread and will mention some not mentioned here:\nObsessive male leads wanting skinship:\n\nInterest of love - love the intense chemistry but toxic relationship vibe. Yoo yeon seok is awesome at this with pretty younger lead Moon ga Young\n\n- he‚Äôs also great in the kdrama Mr Sunshine as second lead who is like Mafia Japanese badass boss  who is unstable and obsessed with FL- all the male leads are obsessed with female lead lol.\n\nNevertheless - controversial toxic kdrama but obsession, chemistry and skinship with Song Kang\n\nSomeone mentioned above: \nThe smile has left your eyes - wow the ML SEO in Guk is amazing and intense in his obsessions, skinship and amazing chemistry with Jung So Min(best chemistry with her ever) - I watched this last year even though it‚Äôs a bit older. But warning is it‚Äôs a ktrauma if you don‚Äôt want that \n\nEmpress ki - I watched half only cos it was getting so long and I went to spoil myself with the rest by reading. But there‚Äôs a lot of intense obsession and chemistry between the first and second male leads with the female lead.\n\nCaptivating the king - Jo Jung seok is amazing at being obsessed with his Korean chess partner who is in fact female (you know this from the start but he doesn‚Äôt) intense longing &amp; obsession \n\nThe recent new release kdrama: \nWhen the Phone Rings \nis the absolute tsundere kdrama - hot CEO possessive cold calculating wow. Intense chemistry and excellent plot\nAll because of Yoo yeon seok of course - he is best at these \nI loved this so much.\n\nEdit: one more that everyone talks about so much that I went to watch it is - Moon lovers: scarlet heart Ryeo - it‚Äôs older but since there‚Äôs so much hype I went to watch it and wow there‚Äôs a lot of obsession and skinship by pretty much all the men (princes‚Äô) to the FL (famous actress and singer IU) haha.\n\nEdit 2: I saw Extraordinary you recommended above but wasn‚Äôt explained why - the biggest obsession is actually from second male lead who is cold and angry lol - which I watch for him Lee Jae Wook (who is also male lead in alchemy of souls)\n\nThe dramas I would watch again that are mentioned above include:\n\nAlchemy of souls s1 &amp; s2- eternal soul fated love - my fave all time - all the men were obsessed with the female lead/s lol.\n\nDoom at your service - awesome chemistry and obsession - seo in Guk is great at these characters \n\nHope these help!",

I largely gave up on Thai dramas because of this so can't recommend many but I definitely suggest you check them out for more extreme insanity.\n\n**Secret**: (Kdrama) starts out incredibly toxic but does get much less insane as the shows goes on.\n\n**PS I Hate You**: (Thai) Soapy melodrama where most characters are completely crazy. I actually fancy watching this one as it looks so silly it will be fun. \n\n**Lighter and Princess**: (Cdrama) Not as extreme as you're after and many seem to love this relationship, but I found this relationship so toxic that I dropped it albeit it's at the less insane end of the scale.\n\n**My Lethal Man**: (Cdrama) Another one I quite fancy watching myself. Sounds moderately insane and toxic.\n\n**Well Intended Love**: (Cdrama) The ML generally treats the FL pretty decently but he does something to her that is so insanely unforgivable that this has to qualify as crazy and toxic.\n\n**Professional Single**: (Cdrama) I dropped this because I thought the ML was toxic and controlling but he's not a psycho- it's the milder end of the unacceptable scale. Plenty of arm grabbing and yanking FL around and being uncomfortably possessive. Show is also a bit boring and romance has no chemistry.\n\n**Wong Wien Hua Jia**: (Thai) is meant to be about as toxic as it gets. Kidnapping, forced marriage, physical violence... it's got it all. It's on my plan to watch list as an example of an extreme lakhorn.\n\n**Kleeun Cheewit**: (Thai) another one with pretty extreme behaviour- this one has the stalking and stuff. Similar concept to Secret where the romance progresses from hate to love.\n\n**Boku no Yabai Tsuma**: (Jdrama) FL realises here husband is having an affair and planning her murder and sets out to take revenge. There's a Korean remake of this too called My Dangerous Wife.\n\n**Game Payabhat**: (Thai) I think this may be exactly what you're looking for. Here are the MDL tags for it: [Violence Against Women](https://mydramalist.com/search?adv=titles&amp;th=11127&amp;so=popular&amp;or=desc),¬†[Abusive Male Lead](https://mydramalist.com/search?adv=titles&amp;th=1559&amp;so=popular&amp;or=desc),¬†[Stockholm Syndrome](https://mydramalist.com/search?adv=titles&amp;th=1379&amp;so=popular&amp;or=desc),¬†[Rape](https://mydramalist.com/search?adv=titles&amp;th=697&amp;so=popular&amp;or=desc),¬†[Slap And Kiss](https://mydramalist.com/search?adv=titles&amp;th=667&amp;so=popular&amp;or=desc),¬†[Kidnapping](https://mydramalist.com/search?adv=titles&amp;th=432&amp;so=popular&amp;or=desc),¬†[Revenge](https://mydramalist.com/search?adv=titles&amp;th=370&amp;so=popular&amp;or=desc),¬†[Violence](https://mydramalist.com/search?adv=titles&amp;th=336&amp;so=popular&amp;or=desc),¬†[Sexual Assault](https://mydramalist.com/search?adv=titles&amp;th=112&amp;so=popular&amp;or=desc)¬†!",

    "body": "Yesss this is one of my favorite  tropes. \n\nOne of my favorites is Moon in the Day. There are two timelines (because reincarnation stuff). In the present day, he wants to kill her, but realizes he‚Äôs actually in love with her. In the past, they‚Äôre enemies. The toxicity comes in with stalking, possessiveness, and uhhh he‚Äôs literally an evil ghost haunting her to kill her. It‚Äôs on a similar level as TTEOTM though, not too dark. Romance genre, but just check out the first few minutes of episode 1‚Äìthe bits in the past set the tone for the show. I will say that, to me, this show is a masterpiece but a slow watch (for something a little more ingestible, watch Born Again). \n\nAn actual dark one that you‚Äôll need to just watch because I can‚Äôt bear to spoil it for you (just trust me) is Rose Mansion/House of Lies. It‚Äôs an incredibly underrated kdrama that I never see it recommended. Thriller genre, with a somewhat romantic element. All the others listed might be too mellow for you, but this one may not be. \n\nFinally, Born Again. Another reincarnation one. Stalker in the 80s, stalker in the current day too‚Ä¶ my bias towards stalker MLs is coming out. üòÇ all the mls from this list are stalkers. But you‚Äôll fall in love with Gong Ji-Chul. He did so many things wrong and yet I still want to defend him when I see the comments upset at him. The 2ML is toxic af too, but in a different way and I HATED that man. But maybe you won‚Äôt. This is a big mix of thriller and romance‚Äîthe romance parts get a little cheesy imo, but the thriller parts are fun. I‚Äôd say turn off your logical brain when watching this one and just enjoy the crazy ride. \n\nI also second Reflection of You and Skip a Beat, but I think they‚Äôll be too light. ML in Skip a Beat is incredibly inconsistent with it and ML in Reflection of You is a sweet kitty kitty meow meow with only a bit of toxic imo. \n\nI don‚Äôt remember if I saw Empress Ki on your list, but when you‚Äôre in the mood for another epic, check it out.",

STRONG FEMALE LEAD : I don't mean literally but a FL who has strong mind and can hold her own and if possible is a leader figure. She is not too dumb or oblivious to the feeling of the suitors.\n2. Not-Simp male lead : This category will most probably eliminate many dramas as mosty MLs falls under the doormat category. I want a ML who has a self or who does not simply exist for the FL but have a presence in himself. Basically who has life of his own apart from chasing FL. If FL does something to hurt his feelings , he speaks up not just takes it in. I hate one particular trope \"I loved you from childhood but i did not tell you and you were dumb enough not to notice and i have kept my V card while you were busy dating other guys\" aka \"I need romance 3\" and its look alikes.\n3. Reasonable break-up/ seperation : I hate it when the couple after getting together has to have a compulsary noble idiocy break up near the end. That's a big no no. Its passable if its reasonable like in \"its ok thats love\" . It should not be like \" I am leaving because of my love for you\" \" I don't deserve you\" crap ,specially near the end.\n4. Understandabe love triangle : If there is love triangle, the main duo should always shine brighter that the 2nd love line and the main girl should be worthy enough to be chased by rich good looking guys . Like in \" Sound of desert \" , she was cool enough to believe that both guys will like her.\n5. Ending : The main couple has to have a conclusive happy ending or a open happy ending. Meaning either they are married or dating with with the feeling that they will be together. I despise sad endings for the main couple. I welcome any other sad elements in the story.\n\nThe shows that I enjoyed are \n\n1.' Witches love'- Mature FL both in looks and mind, great skinship, a hot kiss early(:)) Except the ex everything was perfect\n\n2.' fight for my way ' - friends to lovers to trope that is not one sided. In most of these ,one of the leads(99.999% guys) are waiting hopelessly for the other to notice. Here even though FL had feelings for Ml she did not wait , dated like the ml. Both the couples are different and enjoyable\n\n3 'alchemy of souls' - their is no kdrama like this . The super duper entry scences to slow mature romance to mystery to high quality effects .\n\n4 'legend of shen li'- an actual strong FL and a very calm yet charming ml. the actress did a banger job in this\n\n5 ' story of ming lan '- I was very reluctant to start this long drama . mainly due to actor's looks. he looks uncle type and almost dacade older than the actress in rl. but he grows on you. he is not your typical doormat. TBH it kind of becomes a shonen near the end. I have no complaints.,\n\n6 ' marry my husband' I would prefer the manhwa than the like action but the actress was too charming to ignore this. perfect blend of romance and revenge,\n\n7 ' on the way to the airport'- this one involves cheating but i find myself rooting for them all the same . It has the serene vive about it like 'one spring night'\n\n8 ' marriage not dating'- This one I loved over all but in some instances I hated it to the core \" FL dating kissing other guys while both( fl and ml) having uncertain feelings,, but it has a very good HE ending\n\n9 'sound of desert' - The best love triangle with clear answer at the end . FL has a strong personality and ML inspite of being a doormat for the fl , does not feel like it, instead you will root for the guy. The actor's eyes speaks volumes\n\n10 ' you are my spring' - This one is a better version of ' something in the rain'. The later is noona romance but the vive is very similar . The later would have been the former without the over the top torture that was the 2nd half of SITR\n\nothers are \n\n' hogo's love' , 'it's ok that's love ' , ' I hear your voice' ,  ' the rational life' ,' Eternal love' , 'queen of tears' .  \n\nPlease share your opinions and recommendations.. \n\n^(END OF POST BODY) \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

FL will be a bit unlikeable in the beginning but she has some real character growth.\n\n**Love to Hate you**: a more mature kdrama. FL is a lawyer and hates playboys. ML is a popular actor.
